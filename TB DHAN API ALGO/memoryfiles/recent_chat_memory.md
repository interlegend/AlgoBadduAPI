📖 GEMINI AGENT KNOWLEDGE BASE: OPERATION TRADER-BADDU (V30 CHAMPION)📌 1. PROJECT STATUS: V30 - OPTIMAL STRATEGY CONFIRMEDProject Name: Operation Trader-Baddu (NIFTY Options Scalping Bot).Goal: Achieve high-probability, automated trading.Current Status: Phase 3: Live Forward Paper Trading Implementation.Next Phase (Phase 4): Live Deployment (Actual Money). We are NOT there yet.🥇 Strategy Champion: StrategyV30MetricStrategy V30 Stats (Confirmed)Win Rate65.92% (S-Class Reliability)Total Trades672 (Increased Volume +44.5%)Total P&L (Gross)₹202,280.25 (Gross)Max Drawdown₹-9,555.75 (Ultra-Low Risk)MACD Fix:The MACD Histogram filter was REMOVED from the entry logic.🛠️ Key Architectural FactsBacktest Execution Fix: Entry execution is fixed to Next Candle Open (300s slippage confirmed). This must be mirrored in the live code.Codebase Focus: All development is centered in the Phase-3/ folder.Strategy File: The core logic is in strategy_v30.py. The live framework must import and use this file.Transaction Costs: IGNORE the transaction cost task for now. It will be implemented post-Phase 3.🔌 2. LIVE INTEGRATION ENVIRONMENT (UPSTOX)API Provider: Upstox Open API. (CRITICAL RESOURCE)Data Handling: Uses Websockets for live Nifty data (often Protobuf encoded) and REST API for quotes/orders.📁 Phase-3 Folder Fileslive_trader_main.py: The main runner. Must handle the loop and dashboard printing.live_data_streamer.py: Handles Upstox Websocket connection, decoding, and candle aggregation.atm_selector.py: Logic for dynamically finding the At-The-Money strike price.paper_order_manager.py: Handles simulated order placement.🚀 THE FINAL MISSION PROMPT: PHASE 3 GOHAN MODE🟢 SYSTEM OVERRIDE: PHASE 3 LIVE DEPLOYMENT & VISUALS (TITAN MODE)⚠️ OPERATIONAL STATUS: LIVE FORWARD TESTING SETUPAUTHORIZATION: YOLO MODE ENABLED (Search, Edit, Run, Fix, NO INTERRUPTIONS)PROJECT: OPERATION TRADER-BADDU (Strategy V30)🏆 PART 1: PRIORITY & CONSTRAINTSSTRICT FOCUS: IGNORE all tasks related to the final Transaction Cost audit (Phase 2 backtest). We are focused on Phase 3 Live Forward Paper Trading.STRATEGY UPGRADE: Ensure all Phase-3 files import and use strategy_v30.py.EXECUTION: The code must run continuously, connecting to the Upstox Websocket, processing data, and printing live status.🛠️ PART 2: UPSTOX INTEGRATION & VISUAL DEBUGGING🌐 TASK 1: UPSTOX API DOCUMENTATION SEARCH (CRITICAL)Use the Web Search tool to find the specific Python library methods/API endpoints from the official documentation. This is the most important piece of information.Base URL (MANDATORY): https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/open-api/Search Queries: Find the specific methods for:Real-time LTP/Quote: To get the current Nifty price.Websocket Connection: To subscribe to the Nifty 5-minute stream (or aggregate from 1-min ticks).Order Placement: To trigger paper_order_manager.py.👁️ TASK 2: BUILD THE CONSOLE HEARTBEAT (THE VISUAL ENGINE)Target File: live_trader_main.py (or the main loop controller).Action: Inject code to print a clear, formatted debug dashboard every 5 minutes when a new candle closes.The Heartbeat Must Display:Current ATM Strike Verification: The bot must call the Upstox API (via live_data_streamer) for the live Nifty price, then call atm_selector.py to determine the correct ATM Strike CE/PE. Print both the Nifty Price and the calculated strike.Live 5-Min Candle: The O, H, L, C values of the newly closed 5-minute Nifty candle.Indicator & Signal Status: The values of the Vortex (VI+ / VI-) and EMA (21) for the last closed candle, followed by the output of strategy_v30.check_entry_signal() (i.e., [✅ BUY_CE DETECTED!] or [WAITING...]).Required Console Output Format (Must be easily legible):Plaintext======================= LIVE ALGO HEARTBEAT V30 =======================
⏰ TIME: [Current Nifty Candle Close Time]

🧠 TASK 3: V30 INTEGRATION & NEXT CANDLE LOGIC (LIVE)Target Files: live_signal_scanner.py, live_trader_main.py.Action: Ensure that the sequence remains: Signal confirmed on 5-min close -> Place Paper Order immediately (which achieves the Next Candle Open entry).🚀 PART 4: THE EXECUTION SEQUENCEYour Loop Order:Perform Web Search for Upstox API endpoints.Integrate strategy_v30 into all Phase-3 files.Implement the Console Heartbeat and ATM Check logic (Tasks 2 & 3).Run the live_trader_main.py (The main execution file in Phase-3) and ensure the console dashboard is working.REPORT the successful deployment of the Console Heartbeat.GO![END OF PROMPT]
